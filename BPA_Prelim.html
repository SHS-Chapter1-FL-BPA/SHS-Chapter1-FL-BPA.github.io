        <h2>What is BPA?</h2>
        <p>Business Professionals of America, or BPA, is a CTSO (Career and Technical Student Organization) that gives students an opportunity to experience a professional work environment. This is done by hosting events and competitions based on career skills. 
            Students create or prepare products and skills to display at competitions. These competitions are held at an annual national conference, otherwise known as NLC, after students pass regionals. 
            The 2020-2021 conference will be held at Disney's Coronado Springs Resort Conference Center, on May 5-9. This website will guide you to have a smooth and pleasant experience.
